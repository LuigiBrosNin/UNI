Machine Learning dominates the NLP studies

If we embrace an empiricist view, then for analyzing a specific phenomenon X in a language variety Y (both manually or with computational tools):
1. we have to collect a good set of textual data (a corpus) composed of texts from the language variety Y;
2. we will collect all the occurrences of the phenomenon X from the corpus;
3. we will analyse the occurrences of the phenomenon X to find regularities that will allow us to completely describe the phenomenon inside the corpus;
4. we will generalize our conclusions, derived from corpus analysis, to the entire variety.

==Zipf's law (1949)== -> a small portion of words in a language compose 40~% of each sentence

Linguistic levels:
- Phonetics/Phonology -> how it sounds / shows for sign languages
- Morphology -> the various forms words can have
	- Infection (Derivations, compositions) (eg. cat/cats)
- Syntax -> part of speeches, dependency, parsing, etc
- Semantics -> Lexical semantics (synonymy, antonymy, etc)
- Discourse analysis / Pragmatics
	- Anaphors: ==Mary== is a woman. ==She== loves Jhon.

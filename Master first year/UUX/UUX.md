# Riassunti di Teoria

## 02 - Introduction to UUX

==User Experience== → different definitions with few common elements:

- Emphasis on the product rather than service and the subjective impression of the user
- Usability is one of the parameters
- The product is compared against users’ expectations and interaction context
- The users’ attitude and meaningfulness and voluntarity of the interaction is also important

basically the user’s psychology when using the tool

==Usability== → The extent to which a product can be used by ==specified== ==users== to achieve ==specified goals== with ==effectiveness==, ==efficiency==, and ==satisfaction== in a ==specified== ==context of use.== (ISO 9241-110).

basically the user’s expected efficiency when using the tool

Keywords of **ISO 9241-110**

1. ==Effectiveness== → can users complete tasks, achieve goals with the product, i.e. do what they want to do
2. ==Efficiency== → how much effort do users require to do this? (Often measured in time)
3. ==Satisfaction== → what do users think about the products ease of use?

Keywords of **Jacob Nielsen**

1. ==Learnability== → How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design? ==(beginners)==
2. ==Efficiency== → Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks ==(expert users)==
3. ==Memorability== → When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency? ==(Intermittent users)==
4. ==Errors== → How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
5. ==Satisfaction== → How pleasant is it to use the design?

4 golden rules

1. Think of users
2. Filed test the system
3. Involve users
4. Iterate

## 03 - Design

==System-centered design== → based on designer convenience

==User-centered design== → based on characteristics of end user

- **Task-centered design** (centered on system features)
- **Goal-centered design** (centered on the real goals of the user)

### ==System-centered design==

Level 0: Feature oriented system

- The interface shows everything the system can do
- shallow and extended
- no analysis required

![[Media/Untitled 1 12.png|Untitled 1 12.png]]
eg. the menu of a restaurant

### ==User-centered design==

- Based on the importance of the needs & characteristics of the end user (intellectual, cultural, motivational, physical characteristics)
- ==Interaction design (IXD)== → science that deals with the design of any system that follows user center design principles

==Task oriented design==

- interface around user’s task, not system functions
- system not very extended
- requires some learning
- requires understanding of the users and their task

![[Media/Untitled 2 7.png|Untitled 2 7.png]]
eg. a menu divided by courses

==Goal oriented design==

- takes care of the fundamental goal of the user
- eliminates non relevant tasks, focus on the reasons to use the system
- has to be possible to achieve goals with no learning

==eg. evening out event at a restaurant (goal = nice evening), the food is just 1 element==

---

==Phases of user-centered design==

1. Task and user Analysis
2. Design
3. Validation
4. Testing
5. Iteration

### Two process models:

- ==task oriented model== → Usability design (ISO 9421-210 (2010))
    - official international standard (from UK)
    - aim = usability design
    - 5 phases: Feasibility study, User requirements, Implementation, Evaluation, Deploy
- ==goal oriented model== → User experience design (JJG(2011))
    - well known professional (from USA)
    - aim = user experience design
    - 5 planes: Strategy, Purpose, Structure, Skeleton, Surface

  

## 04 - ISO 9241-210

==ISO 9241-210== → An UK standard on human-centered design (Usability design)

![[Media/Untitled 3 7.png|Untitled 3 7.png]]
- ==Organizational Capability==
    
    the **usability maturity model** in ==ISO (Technical Report) 18529== contains a structured set of processes and survey of good practice models, used to asses the capability of an organization of carrying out user centered design.
    
    ==ISO (Publicly Aware Specification) 18152== extends this to asses the making of an usable, healthy and safe system.
    
- ==Process Quality==
    
    ==ISO 9241-210,== **Ergonomics of human-system interaction**
    
    provides guidance on human-system interaction (in interactive systems)
    
    6 key principles to ensure user-centred design:
    
    1. explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
    2. Users are involved throughout design and development.
    3. The design is driven and refined by user-centred evaluation.
    4. The process is iterative.
    5. The design addresses the whole user experience.
    6. The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.
- ==Product Quality==
    
    **Quality of Software Products** (==ISO 9241-100 series==)
    
    Standards used to support UI development:
    
    - To specify details of the appearance and behavior of the user interface.
    - To provide detailed guidance on the design of user interfaces.
    - To provide criteria for the evaluation of user interfaces.
    
    **Quality of Hardware Products** (==ISO 9241-300 series==)
    
    Standards used to support workplaces and I/O devices:
    
    - Requirements for visual display terminals in offices.
    - Gestures for pen-based systems.
    - Ergonomic requirements for the design of control centers.
- ==Quality in use==
    
    ==ISO/IEC 9126== is a **standard developed as a software engineering process method**.
    
    Describes 6 categories of software quality:
    
    - Functionality
    - Reliability
    - Usability
    - Efficiency
    - Maintainability
    - Portability
    
    ==ISO 9126-1== defines:
    
    - ==Usability== → the capability of the software product to be understood, learned, used and attractive to the user, when used under specified conditions
    - ==Quality== → the capability of the software product to enable specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, productivity, safety and satisfaction in specified contexts of use

### ISO 9241

100 series → Software ergonomics

110 → dialogue principles

200 series → human system interaction processes

210 → human-centred design for interactive systems

300 series → displays and display related hardware

400 series → Physical input devices - ergonomics principles

500 series → Workplace ergonomics

600 series → Environment ergonomics

700 series → Application domains - Control rooms

900 series → Tactile and haptic interactions

# Assignments

## First assignment: spectacularly bad design

[[GIMP- puzzle-based image modifier]]

Free software is the way (Ironic since you’re reading this in Notion), but at the time of writing this, GIMP’s out of touch UI is something that gets the whole program discredited, and many use this argument against free software. I do not agree.

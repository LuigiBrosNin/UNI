Debian 12 doesn't have CUDA toolkit 11.8 so fuck it i'm using colab for my paper. Thanks for nothing, this exam is literally equating to giving birth

Colab also didn't work, now i talked with Lisanti and changed experiment within the paper: no finetuning, but demo inference to study the results.
Useless anyway, i'm gonna work on the presentation now.

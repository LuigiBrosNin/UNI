- Exam
	- An exam consisting of two parts:
	- First part (project):
	- Send prof a list of three articles you are interested in, preferably with the available code. The choice should be based on articles published in the conferences or journals listed in the next slide.
	- you will need to thoroughly study the prof selected article and its related code to replicate at least one experiment presented in the article or conduct a test of your interest by modifying the technique you have studied.
	- If the code is not available, the student should try to re-implement the relative model and replicate one experiment 
	- Prepare a 20-minute presentation that describes the technique proposed in the chosen article and the experiment you conducted.
	- During or at the end of the presentation, I will ask you questions about the work you have done.
	- Second part
	- you will answer general questions on the theory presented in the course.

**Perspective Projection** -> The geometric model of image formation in a pinhole camera

we want to find a relationship between 3d and 2d points:

The above formulas are true because of triangular similarity

Slides seem to be good, and are very visual. There are 41 slides and i don't feel like just adding a phrase and pasting the slide, so i'll freeze notes for now, see what to do of them, studying to slides to understand might be better. Maybe notes to remember definitions, as in summaries.

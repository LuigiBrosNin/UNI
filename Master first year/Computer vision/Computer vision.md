- Exam
	- An exam consisting of two parts:
	- First part (project):
	- Send prof a list of three articles you are interested in, preferably with the available code. The choice should be based on articles published in the conferences or journals listed in the next slide.
	- you will need to thoroughly study the prof selected article and its related code to replicate at least one experiment presented in the article or conduct a test of your interest by modifying the technique you have studied.
	- If the code is not available, the student should try to re-implement the relative model and replicate one experiment 
	- Prepare a 20-minute presentation that describes the technique proposed in the chosen article and the experiment you conducted.
	- During or at the end of the presentation, I will ask you questions about the work you have done.

[Tit for tattling: Cooperation, communication, and how each could stabilize the other](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06792)

# 1 Introduction
1.
Notion of indirect reciprocity

for *reasons* altruism produces a second-order benefit compensating for
its first-order cost, making it potentially evolutionarily viable.

communication is required to disseminate reputation.

2.
> Under what conditions does the interaction between signaling and cooperation stabilize both high levels of (altruistic) cooperation and truthful, informative, and forthcoming (i.e. effective) communication?

3.
Model:
agents evolve over act in a prisoner's dilemma and communicate about the actions of others

Under the conditions that allow for a stable cooperative-communicative state, agents
1. act and signal according to an aligned norm
2. occasionally deviate from their strategy
3. exert normative pressure on each other's signals -> favors altruism and truthfulness

# 2 Background

called **norm** when the strategy encodes a set of rules that is followed by the large majority of a social group.

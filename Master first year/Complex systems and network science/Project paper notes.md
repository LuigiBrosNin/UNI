- describe the model that was implemented and justify all significant design decisions and extensions that were applied to it.
- explain the experiments that you performed in terms of methodology and the results that you obtained
- find tipping points or interesting equilibrium states in your model.

For a good analysis, different values of the parameters should be used
highlighting the differences and impact that each of them have on the model.
You must make previsions and discuss differences between parameters values
as well between the different models. Suggested metrics to be analyzed are
population count of fishes (dolphins population is fixed), max life time among
fishes, average fishes eaten per dolphin. Particular attention should be paid to
collective behaviors of agents, such as self-organization of preys and predators.

PDF report

- describe the model that was implemented and justify all significant design decisions and extensions that were applied to it.
- explain the experiments that you performed in terms of methodology and the results that you obtained
- find tipping points or interesting equilibrium states in your model.

### 1. Baseline model
2d space, agents move (fishes)
- Roaming
- Fleeing
- Reproduce
(Dolphin)
- Roaming
- Hunting
- Eat

params
speed v (slightly higher in dolphins)
vision range $\gamma$   

### 2. Schooling of fish model
Separation: If a fish is inside a threshold distance Î³ near , move away from the nearest fish in the opposite direction to avoid collision.

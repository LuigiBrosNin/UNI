# INTRO
Despite the sheer quantities of data available on the
Web, such information is not always easy to find
->
a new category of professionals emerged who
took on the function of information intermediaries (for a fee).

Commonly, they process, sell, and re-sell data available on the Web.

Numerous new forms of marketplaces for data have emerged.

We have conducted a comprehensive survey and comparison of multiple data
marketplaces and data vendors.

46 suppliers of data, conducted from April to July 2012
aim of identifying categories and dimensions of data marketplaces as well as vendors of data in order to build a taxonomy for data marketplaces.

researching the market and its developments
- understand market dynamics
- new research opportunities into the application of new technologies

# methodology and approach

## Definitions
focused on online web services
- trading data, 
- raw data
- data enrichment tools

data marketplace -> platform on
which anybody can upload and maintain
data sets. 
data vendor -> someone who has data and offers it to others,
either for a given fee or free of charge. 
data enrichment services -> that
take input from the user and enhance it in some
way, e.g., by analyzing or tagging it.

## Approach
initial set based on [14], expanded to 12 boolean dimensions of categorized vendors

The facts about the data vendors were gathered by means of a Web search. 

INSERT TABLE OF DIMENSIONS

## Limitations
The information we used was taken directly from
the website of each vendor. 

The market of data vendors and data market
places is highly active, i.e., new actors emerge and
others disappear, and the market as such is growing
rapidly. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that this
study is fully exhaustive with regard to the number
of vendors in the market. 

we are aware of the fact that a certain amount of data
is traded directly between (large) corporations or
within a certain ecosystem (such as social networks)
without the use of intermediaries. 

# Findings
objective - subjective dimensions

## 1 Type
used to classify vendors
based on what their core product is.

brief description of each with TABLE

## 2 Time frame
captures the temporal context of the data. 
two categories:
- Static/Factual: Data is valid and relevant for
a long period of time and does not change
abruptly, i.e., population numbers, geographical coordinates, etc.
- Up To Date: Data is important shortly after
its creation and loses its relevance quickly, 1. Â¢.,
current stock prices, weather data, or social
media entries.

TABLE, 20% serves both, many specialize

## 3 Domain

what the actual data is about.

any -> vendors are not restricted and can incorporate arbitrary domains

many any -> data
market places, search engines, and customizable
crawlers do indeed serve any domain, depending
on what customers choose to upload or search for.

TABLE

## 4 Data Origin
where it comes from.
describe briefly 6 types
mainly internet
authoritative sources


TABLE

## 5 Pricing model

business models basically, 4 main models
describe briefly
some overlap having combined models

TABLE

## 6 data access
which means end-users receive their data from vendors.
4 categories, describe briefly
API flexible, less than 30% of API services have only API

TABLE

## 7 Data output

format of data
reasonable set composed of , list, not described necessary i suppose? maybe very briefly 

TABLE

## 8 Language
English dominant, website and data distinction in tables

TABLE

## 9 Target Audience
B2B fashion is the most
logical application area of data vending.

The more
general vendors target their offer at all audiences. 

TABLE

---
subjective dimensions

## 10 Trustworthiness
depending on the origin of the data as well as on how it is processed. 

types for each category, explained with examples

TABLE
overlap because of multiple sources

## 11 Size of vendor

division startup -> global player
low startups, market not easy to enter

TABLE

## 12 Maturity

When there are already established
vendors with mature projects, the space for new
companies to enter the market is relatively small.

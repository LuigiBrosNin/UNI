- Exam info
	project followed by Gabrielli and Zingaro, easy exam (at least as Gabrielli says)
	group of 1->4 people, ideally 3, but they're flexible
	discussion is about the project mainly, and important theory stuff, but not much in depth

# Teoria
## Intro
> [!note] Artificial Intelligence Definitions (informal)
> 1. Turing's imitation game test
> 2. "Knowing what to do when you don't know what to do"
> 3. Models that are designed to generate new content, such as images, text, audio, or even video (Generative AI)
> 4. Thinking/Acting humanly, Thinking/Acting rationally

**Artificial General Intelligence** (AGI) -> AGI is envisioned as having the capability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can do

To solve problems with AI, there's not a defined algorithm, but we **train** (a neural network) to adjust the model's result trough labeled data (basically data with solutions).
In Training phase each neuron has a simple function $f(x)=\alpha x$ where is is a real number, the weight of $x$ on the final decision (output).
Comparing the $output\ net - desired \ output$ will make sure that the error will be lower.
There are different measures to attest the efficiency of the model, one of them is *accuracy*, but there are many others that have to be used case per case. as accuracy is not always a good metric.

3 types of AI
- Symbolic AI -> Rule based systems

## Neural Networks

i'm following the lessons without notes, as there are some notes on CSUnibo i could study into, i might still do summaries and exam resources. as usual i recommend Cortigiano's notes (italian notes).

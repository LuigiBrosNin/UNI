## Theory

### Intro

Weaver's 3 classes of problems:
- Problems of simplicity -> few variables with well known relations (eg. $F=ma$)
- Problems of *==disorganized==* complexity -> 
	- billions+ of variables
	- random "disorganized" variables with little relations
	- allows statistical methods for describing behaviors trough averages
	- eg. temperature and pressure of air molecules that results in winds
- Problems of *==organized==* complexity ->
	- middle ground in the number of variables
	- strong, nonlinear interactions
	- "The whole is **more** than the sum of its parts"

Examples of complex systems
	-  Social insects

	-  The human brain
	- The mammalian immune system
	- Economies, financial markets
	- Cities, traffic
	- Data centers
	- The Internet
	- Peer-to-peer systems
	- The World Wide Web

Interactions among agents is central to complex systems
Networks allows us to monitor these interactions and thus are important in the study of complex systems.

Common proprieties of complex systems
- **Simple components** -> agents, actors
- **Decentralized control** -> no distinguished “master”
- **Nonlinear interactions** -> components act autonomously but interact with other components directly or indirectly
- **Emergent behavior** -> the global system exhibits properties that cannot be derived or predicted from understanding behaviors of individual components

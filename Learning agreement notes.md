This may not apply to the join master program in Nice, so we'll see about it

balancing CFUs:
- you can balance different courses CFU as long as they all retain the topic you would study here, eg:
	- 9 CFU Ingegneria del software -> 2 courses (6+6 CFU) in compatible Software engineering topics
	- 6 CFU Deep learning -> 1 course (3 CFU) in compatible deep learning topics
	- they balance out the CFUs so it's fine (this case if it's 2 obligatory courses)
- alternatively, in the SE course, the extra 3 CFU courses can be counted for the free choices ones

Feel free to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or download my repository and [import it on obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Manage+vaults) for offline ease of reading.

Alternatively, you can read everything here!
